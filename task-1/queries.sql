FROM books
WHERE genre = 'Science Fiction'
ORDER BY published_year ASC;

-- **Question 2** — Show every book published before 1950. Display the title and year only.
SELECT title, published_year
FROM books
WHERE published_year < 1950;

-- **Question 3** — Show every book in the database along with its author's full name. Combine `first_name` and `last_name` into a single column called `author`. (Hint: you will need a JOIN.)
SELECT b.title, b.published_year, a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name AS author
FROM books b
JOIN authors a ON a.id = b.author_id;

-- **Question 4** — List all books written by Stephen King. Show the title and published year, ordered by year. (Hint: JOIN the two tables and filter on the author's name.)
SELECT b.title, b.published_year
FROM books b
JOIN authors a ON a.id = b.author_id
WHERE a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name = 'Stephen King'
ORDER BY b.published_year;

-- **Question 5** — Add yourself as a new author. Use your real name, or make one up. Pick any nationality and birth year.
INSERT INTO authors (first_name, last_name, nationality, birth_year)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'American', 1990);

-- **Question 6** — Add one book for the author you just inserted. It can be a real book or a made-up one.
INSERT INTO books (title, published_year, genre, author_id)
VALUES ('My Amazing Book', 2024, 'Fiction', 25);

-- **Question 7** — The genre for "The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger" was entered incorrectly as 'Fantasy'. It should be 'Horror'. Write an UPDATE to fix it, then verify the change with a SELECT.

SET genre = 'Horror'
WHERE title = 'The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger';

SELECT title, genre
FROM books
WHERE title = 'The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger';

-- **Question 8** — Delete the book you added in Question 6. Make sure your query targets only that specific row.
